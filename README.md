* Practice core data analysis techniques

* Understand real-world dataset structures

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* Generate insights using statistical measures

* Visualize patterns and trends

## Tasks Completed
### Task 1 – Top Cuisines

* Identified the top three most common cuisines

* Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving these cuisines

## Key Focus:
Data transformation, frequency analysis, percentage calculation

## Task 2 – City Analysis

* Determined the city with the highest number of restaurants

* Calculated the average rating for each city

* Identified the city with the highest average rating

## Key Focus:
Grouping, aggregation, comparative analysis

## Task 3 – Price Range Distribution

* Visualized the distribution of restaurant price ranges

* Calculated percentage distribution across categories

## Key Focus:
Data visualization, categorical analysis

## Task 4 – Online Delivery

* Calculated percentage of restaurants offering online delivery

* Compared ratings between restaurants with and without delivery

## Key Focus:
Comparative analytics, business insight generation
